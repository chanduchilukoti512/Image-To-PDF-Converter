# Image to PDF Converter

This is a simple web application that allows users to upload one or more images and convert them into a single PDF file. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with the help of the `jsPDF` library to generate the PDF from images.

## Features

- Upload multiple images
- Convert selected images into a single PDF
- Download the PDF after conversion

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- jsPDF library

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-to-pdf-converter.git
    ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.

3. Select one or more images using the file input.

4. Click the "Convert to PDF" button.

5. The PDF file containing all the selected images will be generated and downloaded automatically.

## How It Works

The application uses the `jsPDF` library to generate PDFs. It allows users to select images, and for each image, it creates a new page in the PDF document. Once all images are processed, the PDF is ready for download.

## Future Enhancements

- Add image resizing options to fit images on the page.
- Support for different image formats (JPG, PNG, etc.).
